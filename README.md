# Claudium

> **English** · [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

All Anthropic OAuth stripped. All telemetry stripped. All injected security-prompt guardrails removed. All experimental features unlocked. One binary, zero callbacks home.

### Stable (main branch)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Flybicy/claudium/main/install.sh | bash
```

> One command installs all dependencies first (git, Bun >= 1.3.11, ripgrep), then clones, builds with all features enabled, installs `claudium`, and creates a `claudium-bypass` launcher that starts in bypass permission mode. See [API Configuration](#api-configuration) for API setup.

### Dev (bleeding edge)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Flybicy/claudium/main/install_dev.sh | bash
```

> Installs from the `dev` branch as `claudium` (and `claudium-bypass`). Same binary names as the stable installer — only the source branch differs.

## What is this

This is a clean, buildable fork of Anthropic's [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) CLI -- the terminal-native AI coding agent. The upstream source became publicly available on March 31, 2026 through a source map exposure in the npm distribution.

This fork applies six categories of changes on top of that snapshot:

### 1. Privacy-First

Eliminates all tracking and remote-control mechanisms present in the original Claude Code:

- No telemetry -- No unnecessary data is transmitted to Anthropic servers
- No analytics -- No usage tracking or event logging
- No fingerprinting -- No user or environment identification
- No auto-updates -- No remote version control or forced updates

### 2. OAuth and Cloud Services Stripped

Unlike the upstream Claude Code, Claudium has no OAuth login, no claude.ai remote sessions, and no cloud provider integration:

- No `/login` command -- authenticating with claude.ai OAuth is removed
- No remote CCR sessions -- all bridge/remote session code is stripped
- No GrowthBook server-side feature flag dependency
- No auto-update infrastructure
- No settings sync to/from cloud

All authentication is done via API keys (see [API Configuration](#api-configuration)).

### 3. OpenAI-compatible API support

Added an API shim layer (`src/services/api/openaiShim.ts`) that transparently translates between Anthropic message format and OpenAI-compatible APIs. It supports both Chat Completions and the newer Responses API, so all Claudium tools (bash, file read/write, grep, glob, agents, MCP, etc.) keep working while you swap in a different backend LLM.

### 4. SearXNG-backed WebSearch

Added an optional override for the built-in `WebSearch` tool so it can query your own SearXNG instance instead of relying on provider-side web search.

- Configured with one env var: `CLAUDE_CODE_SEARXNG_BASE_URL`
- Keeps the existing `WebSearch` tool contract and UI intact
- Preserves `allowed_domains` / `blocked_domains` semantics with local filtering
- Falls back to the default provider behavior when the env var is unset

### 5. Security-prompt guardrails removed

Anthropic injects system-level instructions into every conversation that constrain Claude's behavior beyond what the model itself enforces. These include:

- Hardcoded refusal patterns for certain categories of prompts
- Injected "cyber risk" instruction blocks
- Managed-settings security overlays pushed from Anthropic's servers

This build strips those injections. The model's own safety training still applies -- this just removes the extra layer of prompt-level restrictions that the CLI wraps around it.

### 6. Experimental features enabled

Claude Code ships with dozens of feature flags gated behind `bun:bundle` compile-time switches. Most are disabled in the public npm release. This build unlocks all 45+ flags that compile cleanly, including:

| Feature | What it does |
|---|---|
| `ULTRAPLAN` | Remote multi-agent planning on Claude Code web (Opus-class) |
| `ULTRATHINK` | Deep thinking mode -- type "ultrathink" to boost reasoning effort |
| `VOICE_MODE` | Push-to-talk voice input and dictation |
| `AGENT_TRIGGERS` | Local cron/trigger tools for background automation |
| `BRIDGE_MODE` | IDE remote-control bridge (VS Code, JetBrains) |
| `TOKEN_BUDGET` | Token budget tracking and usage warnings |
| `BUILTIN_EXPLORE_PLAN_AGENTS` | Built-in explore/plan agent presets |
| `VERIFICATION_AGENT` | Verification agent for task validation |
| `BASH_CLASSIFIER` | Classifier-assisted bash permission decisions |
| `EXTRACT_MEMORIES` | Post-query automatic memory extraction |
| `HISTORY_PICKER` | Interactive prompt history picker |
| `MESSAGE_ACTIONS` | Message action entrypoints in the UI |
| `QUICK_SEARCH` | Prompt quick-search |
| `SHOT_STATS` | Shot-distribution stats |
| `COMPACTION_REMINDERS` | Smart reminders around context compaction |
| `CACHED_MICROCOMPACT` | Cached microcompact state through query flows |

See [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md) for the full audit of all 88 flags and their status.

## Repository (clone / pull / push)

This repo ships ready for GitHub. To publish your own copy:

```bash
# 1) Create an empty repo on GitHub (e.g. github.com/you/claudium), then:
cd claudium
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/you/claudium.git
git push -u origin main
```

To pull updates and rebuild:

```bash
git pull --ff-only                  # fast-forward only; never auto-merge
bun install                         # sync deps if package.json/lock changed
bun run build:dev:claudium          # rebuild claudium-cli-dev
```

If you have local changes and want to re-sync with upstream cleanly:

```bash
git stash                           # park your edits
git pull --ff-only
git stash pop                       # reapply
```

---

## Quick install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Flybicy/claudium/main/install.sh | bash
```

One command does everything: it installs **all dependencies first** (git,
Bun >= 1.3.11, and ripgrep -- via your system package manager: apt / dnf /
yum / pacman / zypper / apk / brew; on Windows Git Bash: scoop / choco /
winget or a direct release download), then clones the repo source, runs
`bun install` (project dependencies incl. the local-semantic embedding
runtime), builds the binary `claudium-cli-dev` (all experimental features
enabled), installs it as `claudium`, and creates a `claudium-bypass`
launcher in `~/.local/bin`.

### Windows (native)

Claudium builds and runs natively on Windows (no WSL needed). Use the
PowerShell installer, which installs **all dependencies first** (git, Bun,
and ripgrep -- via winget/choco/scoop), then clones the repo, runs
`bun install`, and builds a `claudium-cli-dev.exe`:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Flybicy/claudium/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

Or, if you already have Bun + ripgrep, build from source as on any other OS
(see [Build](#build)). **ripgrep (`rg`) must be on your PATH** -- Claudium
does NOT bundle it; install it with `scoop install ripgrep`,
`winget install BurntSushi.ripgrep.MSVC`, or `choco install ripgrep`.

> Note: ripgrep is not bundled by Claudium; it's a system dependency on all
> platforms (brew/apt install ripgrep on macOS/Linux).

---

## Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) >= 1.3.11
- macOS, Linux, or Windows (native build; WSL optional but not required)
- An API key ([Anthropic Messages](#anthropic-messages-api) or [OpenAI-compatible APIs](#openai-compatible-apis))

```bash
# Install Bun if you don't have it
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

---

## Build

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Flybicy/claudium.git
cd claudium

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Standard build -- produces ./claudium-cli
bun run build

# Dev build -- dev version stamp, experimental GrowthBook key
bun run build:dev

# Dev build with ALL experimental features enabled -- produces ./claudium-cli-dev
bun run build:dev:full

# Compiled build (alternative output path) -- produces ./dist/claudium-cli
bun run compile
```

### Build variants

| Command | Output | Features | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bun run build` | `./claudium-cli` | `VOICE_MODE` only | Production-like binary |
| `bun run build:dev` | `./claudium-cli-dev` | `VOICE_MODE` only | Dev version stamp |
| `bun run build:dev:full` | `./claudium-cli-dev` | All 45+ experimental flags | The full unlock build |
| `bun run compile` | `./dist/claudium-cli` | `VOICE_MODE` only | Alternative output directory |

### Individual feature flags

You can enable specific flags without the full bundle:

```bash
# Enable just ultraplan and ultrathink
bun run ./scripts/build.ts --feature=ULTRAPLAN --feature=ULTRATHINK

# Enable a specific flag on top of the dev build
bun run ./scripts/build.ts --dev --feature=BRIDGE_MODE
```

---

## Run

```bash
# Run the installed binary
claudium

# Run the installed binary in bypass permission mode
claudium-bypass

# Or the built binary
./claudium-cli

# Or the dev binary
./claudium-cli-dev

# Or run from source without compiling (slower startup)
bun run dev

# See [API Configuration](#api-configuration) for API setup.
```

`claudium-bypass` is installed by `install.sh`. It exports `IS_SANDBOX=1` and runs the installed `claudium` binary with `--permission-mode bypassPermissions`.

### Quick test

```bash
# One-shot mode
claudium -p "what files are in this directory?"

# One-shot mode with bypass permission mode enabled
claudium-bypass -p "scan this repo and summarize risky scripts"

# Interactive REPL (default)
claudium

# Interactive REPL (bypassPermissions)
claudium-bypass

# With specific model
claudium --model claude-sonnet-4-6-20250514

# Set advisor model
claudium --advisor-model claude-sonnet-4-6-20250514
```

## Advisor Tool

Claudium includes a built-in **Advisor** tool that runs a stronger reviewer model
to audit your approach before you commit to implementation. The advisor checks for
architecture flaws, security issues, edge cases, and correctness.

- Configured via `CLAUDE_CODE_ADVISOR_MODEL` or the `/advisor <model>` slash command
- Provider-agnostic — works with any model, including OpenAI-compatible backends
- Automatically called by the executor model on the first significant action of each task
- Also available for manual review: call the `Advisor` tool with your question

```bash
# Enable via env var
export CLAUDE_CODE_ADVISOR_MODEL="claude-opus-4-6"

# Enable via slash command (interactive session)
/advisor claude-opus-4-6

# Disable
/advisor off
```

### ReadConversationLog -- semantic & hybrid search

The Advisor reads the main agent's conversation history through its
`ReadConversationLog` tool. It now supports three search **modes** when using
`action: "search"`:

| mode | what it does | when to use |
|---|---|---|
| `keyword` (default) | BM25 exact-term search | identifiers, file names, error codes, exact API names |
| `semantic` | embedding-vector cosine similarity | the topic may be discussed using different words than your query |
| `hybrid` | reciprocal-rank fusion (RRF, k=60) of keyword + semantic | broad questions; a good default |

The Advisor is actively prompted to pick a mode deliberately: keyword for
exactness, semantic for paraphrase/concept recall, hybrid for broad recall.
Search output always **labels the embedding backend in use**, so the Advisor
knows which one ran and never gets silent fallback.

#### Embedding backends

Semantic and hybrid modes need embeddings. Claudium runs them **fully local**
-- no API key, no per-token cost, your conversation text never leaves the
machine. Two backends, resolved in this priority order:

1. **local-semantic** (default, true semantics) -- a real embedding model
   running **in-process** via
   [`@huggingface/transformers`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js)
   (ONNX/WASM, mean-pooled + L2-normalized), labeled
   `local-semantic:<model>`. The package is a normal dependency, so
   `bun install` (or the one-line installer) brings it in automatically --
   **clone, install, done**. On first use the model downloads itself once
   into the on-disk cache; afterwards everything works fully offline.
   Vectors are additionally cached on disk (JSONL per model), so unchanged
   messages are never re-embedded, even across restarts.
   Note: the standalone `--compile` binary cannot embed the transformers
   package; there it degrades with a clear error -- set
   `CLAUDE_CODE_ADVISOR_LOCAL_EMBEDDING=0` in that case.
2. **local-approximate** (fallback) -- a deterministic, offline, free,
   hashed bag-of-features vectorizer. It is **NOT** true semantics; it
   provides fuzzy sub-word matching on top of what BM25 already does. Always
   labeled `local-approximate` in tool output, so the Advisor is told to
   lean toward keyword mode for exactness when it sees this label. Used when
   you opt out of the model tier (`CLAUDE_CODE_ADVISOR_LOCAL_EMBEDDING=0`).

**Model download sizes** (quantized q8, one-time, includes tokenizer/config):

| Model | Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (default) | ~23 MB | fast, English-leaning |
| `Xenova/bge-small-zh-v1.5` | ~23 MB | **recommended for Chinese** conversations |
| `Xenova/multilingual-e5-small` | ~120 MB | strongest multilingual recall |

Pick a model with `CLAUDE_CODE_ADVISOR_LOCAL_EMBEDDING_MODEL`. The download
lands in the cache dir (next to the vector cache) and is reused forever.

#### Embedding environment variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE_CODE_ADVISOR_LOCAL_EMBEDDING_MODEL` | Transformers.js/ONNX model id for the local-semantic tier (default `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`; use `Xenova/bge-small-zh-v1.5` for Chinese). Downloaded once on first use, then offline. |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_ADVISOR_LOCAL_EMBEDDING` | Set to `0`, `false`, or `off` to skip the model tier and use the approximate local fallback instead. |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_ADVISOR_SEMANTIC_SEARCH` | Set to `0`, `false`, or `off` to disable semantic/hybrid modes entirely (mode then ignored, keyword used). Alias: `CLAUDE_CODE_SEMANTIC_SEARCH`. |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_ADVISOR_EMBEDDING_CACHE_DIR` | Override the on-disk cache directory for models and vectors (useful for tests / ephemeral CI). |

**Example (Chinese conversations):**
```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_ADVISOR_LOCAL_EMBEDDING_MODEL="Xenova/bge-small-zh-v1.5"
# first semantic search downloads ~23 MB once; everything is offline after that
```

If the model tier is unavailable (e.g. inside the compiled binary without
the opt-out), semantic/hybrid modes report a clear error and hybrid degrades
to keyword-only; keyword mode is always available regardless.

### ReadConversationLog -- project memory across restarts

The Advisor's conversation log also keeps a **per-project long-term memory**:
every snapshot is persisted (de-duplicated by content fingerprint) to a small
JSONL archive keyed by the project directory. After a restart, or in a
brand-new session in the same project, the Advisor can still search and read
what was discussed before -- prior entries appear in `index` tagged
`(prior session)` with high ids (`>= 1000000`), and work with every action
(`search`, `read`, `around`, both keyword and semantic modes).

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE_CODE_ADVISOR_PROJECT_MEMORY` | Set to `0`, `false`, or `off` to disable the per-project archive entirely. |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_ADVISOR_PROJECT_MEMORY_DIR` | Override the archive directory (default: a per-project hash dir under the OS cache dir). |

The archive is FIFO-bounded (newest 4000 entries), never duplicates unchanged
messages across runs/resumes, and all persistence is best-effort -- a failing
disk never breaks the Advisor.

## API Configuration

Claudium supports both **Anthropic Messages API** (natively) and **OpenAI-compatible APIs**. The shim can use either Chat Completions or the newer Responses API depending on the provider and model you configure.

Note: Unlike the upstream Claude Code, Claudium does **not** support OAuth login via claude.ai. All authentication is done via API keys.

### Anthropic Messages API

Use the official Anthropic Messages API with your Anthropic API key.

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
```

### OpenAI-compatible APIs

Enable OpenAI-compatible mode and configure your preferred provider:

```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_OPENAI=1
```

#### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | API key (required for cloud APIs, optional for local models) |
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | API base URL (default: `https://api.openai.com/v1`) |
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | Model ID (default: `gpt-4o`) |
| `OPENAI_API_MODE` | Force transport selection: `chat_completions` or `responses` |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL` | Override which concrete model the `opus` alias resolves to |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL` | Override which concrete model the `sonnet` alias resolves to |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL` | Override which concrete model the `haiku` alias resolves to |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS` | Override max context window size |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_SUMMARY_OUTPUT_TOKENS` | Override token limit for summarized context |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_BUFFER_TOKENS` | Override auto-compact buffer size |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_ADVISOR_MODEL` | Set the advisor/reviewer model (provider-agnostic) |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS` | Override max context window size for subagents |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_BUFFER_TOKENS` | Override auto-compact buffer size for subagents |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_SUMMARY_OUTPUT_TOKENS` | Override summary output token reservation for subagents |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_ADVISOR_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS` | Override max context window size for the advisor tool |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_ADVISOR_BUFFER_TOKENS` | Override auto-compact buffer size for the advisor tool |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_ADVISOR_SUMMARY_OUTPUT_TOKENS` | Override summary output token reservation for the advisor tool |

**Autocompact buffer** = `CLAUDE_CODE_SUMMARY_OUTPUT_TOKENS` + `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_BUFFER_TOKENS`

#### Subagent & Advisor Context Configuration

Subagents (spawned via the `Agent` tool) and the `Advisor` tool each run their own
query loops with independent context management. By default they inherit the same
context window, auto-compact buffer, and summary output reservation as the main
agent. You can override these independently using env vars or `settings.json`.

**Env vars (highest priority):**
```bash
# Subagent overrides
export CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS=100000
export CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_BUFFER_TOKENS=5000
export CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_SUMMARY_OUTPUT_TOKENS=8000

# Advisor overrides
export CLAUDE_CODE_ADVISOR_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS=150000
export CLAUDE_CODE_ADVISOR_BUFFER_TOKENS=10000
export CLAUDE_CODE_ADVISOR_SUMMARY_OUTPUT_TOKENS=16000
```

**settings.json (persistent config):**
```json
{
  "subagentContextWindow": 100000,
  "subagentBufferTokens": 5000,
  "subagentSummaryOutputTokens": 8000,
  "advisorContextWindow": 150000,
  "advisorBufferTokens": 10000,
  "advisorSummaryOutputTokens": 16000
}
```

**Priority chain** (each parameter independently):
1. context-specific env var (e.g. `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS`)
2. context-specific `settings.json` field (e.g. `subagentContextWindow`)
3. general env var (e.g. `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS`)
4. model default

Context window overrides use `min()` semantics — they only cap downward, never
expand beyond what the model supports.

**Calculation reminder:**
```
effectiveWindow = min(modelContextWindow, contextWindowOverride, AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW)
                   - summaryOutputTokens
compactThreshold = effectiveWindow - bufferTokens
totalBuffer       = summaryOutputTokens + bufferTokens  (default: 20000 + 13000 = 33000)
```

Use `OPENAI_MODEL` when you want to pin the whole session to one exact model. Use `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL`, `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL`, and `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL` when you want aliases such as `opus`, `sonnet`, and `haiku` to resolve to your own provider-specific model IDs.

#### Transport selection

- Codex aliases such as `codexplan` and `codexspark` also use the unified Responses transport, but through the ChatGPT Codex auth/backend path.
- Other OpenAI-compatible backends stay on Chat Completions by default for maximum compatibility unless you explicitly select Responses.
- Official OpenAI requests that include reasoning still use the Responses API.
- Set `OPENAI_API_MODE=responses` to force `/responses` on providers that support it, or `OPENAI_API_MODE=chat_completions` to force the legacy path.

#### Provider Examples

**OpenAI (Responses API, explicit):**
```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_OPENAI=1
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5.4
export OPENAI_API_MODE=responses
```

**OpenAI ChatGPT:**
```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_OPENAI=1
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o
export OPENAI_API_MODE=chat_completions
```

**OpenAI ChatGPT Codex:**
```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_OPENAI=1
export CODEX_API_KEY=eyJ...
export CHATGPT_ACCOUNT_ID=account_...
export OPENAI_MODEL=codexplan
```

**OpenRouter:**
```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_OPENAI=1
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
export OPENAI_MODEL=openai/gpt-5.4
```

```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_OPENAI=1
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.deepseek.com/v1
export OPENAI_MODEL=deepseek-chat
```

**LLaMA.CPP (local):**
```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_OPENAI=1
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:1234/v1
export OPENAI_MODEL=your-model-name
export CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS=65536

export AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-12-01-preview
```

### SearXNG-backed WebSearch

You can route Claudium's built-in `WebSearch` tool through your own SearXNG instance by setting one environment variable:

```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_SEARXNG_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8888/
```

When this variable is set, `WebSearch` no longer relies on the provider's server-side web search. Instead, Claudium calls your SearXNG instance directly at:

```text
GET {CLAUDE_CODE_SEARXNG_BASE_URL}/search?q=<query>&format=json
```

Notes:

- This only changes the `WebSearch` tool. `WebFetch` still fetches page content directly.
- `allowed_domains` and `blocked_domains` are still supported, but filtering is applied locally after SearXNG returns results.
- If `CLAUDE_CODE_SEARXNG_BASE_URL` is unset, Claudium falls back to the default provider behavior.
